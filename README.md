# AUTOMATIC-ROOM-LIGHT

## OVERVIEW

  Automatic Room Lights System using Arduino is a very useful project as you need not to worry about turning on and off the         switches every time you want to turn on the lights . In fact, the Automatic Room Lights project can be considered as one       major application of the PIR Sensor. 

## COMPONENTS USED

  Arduino UNO
  PIR Sensor
  LED
  100Ω Resistor (1/4 Watt)
  Connecting Wires  
  Breadboard
  Power Supply

## WORKING

  The Automatic Room Lights using Arduino and PIR Sensor is a simple project, where the lights in the room will automatically     turn on upon detecting a human motion and stay turned on until the person has left or there is no motion.

  Working of this project is very simple and is explained here.

  Initially, when there is no human movement, the PIR Sensor doesn’t detect any person and its OUT pin stays LOW. As the person   enters the room, the change in infrared radiation in the room is detected by the PIR Sensor.As a result, the output of the     PIR Sensor becomes HIGH. Since the Data OUT of the PIR Sensor is connected to Digital Pin 8 of   Arduino, whenever it becomes   HIGH, Arduino will activate the relay by making the relay pin LOW (as the relay module is an       active LOW module).This     will turn the Light ON. The light stays turned ON as long as there is movement in front of the sensor.

  If the person takes a nap or leaves the room, the IR Radiation will become stable (there will be no change) and hence, the     Data OUT of the PIR Sensor will become LOW. This in turn will make the Arduino to turn OFF the relay (make the relay pin       HIGH) and the room light will be turned OFF.
